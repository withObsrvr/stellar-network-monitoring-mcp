### Changed

#### üîÑ Tool Optimization (26 ‚Üí 18 tools, 31% reduction)
- **Consolidated redundant tools**: Merged `get_network_statistics` into `get_network_status`
- **Enhanced search capabilities**: Combined location and version filters into `search_nodes`
- **Removed low-value tools**: Eliminated `export_network_data`, `get_node_snapshots`, etc.
- **Prioritized workflow tools**: Positioned high-level tools first in tool list

#### üìà Performance Improvements
- **Reduced cognitive load** for LLMs with fewer, more focused tools
- **Improved response quality** through structured workflow analysis
- **Better error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Optimized API calls** with intelligent caching and rate limiting

#### üéØ User Experience Enhancements
- **Task-oriented design** focusing on user goals rather than API endpoints
- **Intelligent defaults** for all optional parameters
- **Contextual recommendations** in all workflow responses
- **Cross-tool integration** for seamless analysis flows

### Breaking Changes

#### Removed Tools (8 tools)
- `get_network_statistics` ‚Üí Merged into `get_network_status`
- `get_all_nodes` ‚Üí Use `search_nodes` without filters instead
- `get_node_snapshots` ‚Üí Historical data integrated into health checks
- `get_organization_snapshots` ‚Üí Historical data integrated into organization analysis
- `export_network_data` ‚Üí Removed (rarely needed by LLMs)
- `get_performance_metrics` ‚Üí Functionality integrated into other tools
- `find_nodes_by_location` ‚Üí Merged into `search_nodes`
- `get_nodes_by_version` ‚Üí Merged into `search_nodes`

#### Tool Prioritization
- **Workflow tools listed first** to encourage high-level usage patterns
- **Core tools organized by function** for logical grouping
- **Deprecated patterns** removed in favor of workflow-based approach

### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users
If you were using the removed tools, here are the replacements:

- **`get_network_statistics`** ‚Üí Use `get_network_status` (includes statistics)
- **`get_all_nodes`** ‚Üí Use `search_nodes` with no filter parameters
- **`find_nodes_by_location`** ‚Üí Use `search_nodes` with `location` parameter
- **`get_nodes_by_version`** ‚Üí Use `search_nodes` with `version` parameter
- **Complex analysis** ‚Üí Use new workflow tools like `investigate_network_issues`

#### For New Users
- **Start with workflow tools** for comprehensive analysis
- **Use specific tools** only when you need focused data
- **Leverage natural language** - the tools understand conversational queries
- **Check the examples** in USAGE_EXAMPLES.md for common patterns
