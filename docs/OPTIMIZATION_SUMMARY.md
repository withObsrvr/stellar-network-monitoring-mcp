## üìä Before vs. After Comparison

### Tool Count Optimization
| Category | Before | After | Change |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Network Tools** | 8 | 5 | -3 (consolidated) |
| **Node Tools** | 12 | 6 | -6 (merged & streamlined) |
| **Organization Tools** | 5 | 2 | -3 (focused on essentials) |
| **Workflow Tools** | 0 | 5 | +5 (new category) |
| **Total** | **26** | **18** | **-8 (-31%)** |

### Description Quality Enhancement

**Before (API-focused):**
```yaml
description: "Get overall network health, consensus status, and key metrics"
```

**After (LLM-optimized):**
```yaml
description: `Quick overview of current Stellar network health and status.

Use this when a user asks:
- "How is the Stellar network doing?"
- "What's the current network status?"
- "Quick network health check"

DO NOT use this for:
- Detailed problem diagnosis (use investigate_network_issues instead)
- Validator performance analysis (use monitor_validator_performance instead)

Examples:
- User: "Is the network healthy?"
- User: "Quick status check"`
```

## üöÄ New Workflow Tools

### 1. `investigate_network_issues`
**Purpose**: Complete network health investigation
**Combines**: Status check + Issue detection + Node analysis + Recommendations
**Use Case**: "Is there a problem with the Stellar network?"

### 2. `monitor_validator_performance`  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validator monitoring
**Combines**: Validator listing + Performance ranking + Failure analysis + Distribution
**Use Case**: "How are validators performing?"

### 3. `analyze_organization_health`
**Purpose**: Full organization analysis
**Combines**: Org details + Reliability analysis + Node listing + Health scoring
**Use Case**: "How is OBSRVR performing?"

### 4. `analyze_network_diversity`
**Purpose**: Decentralization assessment  
**Combines**: Geographic analysis + Org diversity + Risk assessment + Recommendations
**Use Case**: "How decentralized is the Stellar network?"

### 5. `troubleshoot_consensus_issues`
**Purpose**: Consensus problem diagnosis
**Combines**: Consensus analysis + Quorum health + Validator participation + Diagnosis
**Use Case**: "Why isn't consensus working?"
